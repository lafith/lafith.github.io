I am a /Senior Deep Learning Engineer/ at the [[https://igrs.hticlab.org/][Image-Guided Robotics Group]], [[https://www.hticiitm.org/][HTIC–IIT Madras]], where we develop medical robotic systems. Our current projects include a Robotic Fetal Ultrasound System and a Spine Surgery Robot. My work focuses on integrating AI-driven computer vision to improve accuracy and efficiency in healthcare.

Previously, I was a Visiting Research Scholar at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, working under [[https://www.uab.edu/shp/home/about-us/deans-office/staff/ritu-aneja][Dr. Ritu Aneja]]. My research focused on deep learning-based analysis of whole slide images from breast cancer patients, leveraging AI to improve pathology insights.

I hold a B.Tech in Biomedical Engineering from NIT Rourkela (2021). My expertise spans:
- AI-driven image analysis
- Computational pathology
- Simulation and Robotics
- Virtual Reality application
- Image processing and enhancement
  
I am passionate about advancing AI and robotics- developing intelligent systems that bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and real-world applications. I welcome connections and collaborations in this exciting field!
