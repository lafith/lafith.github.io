I am an R&D Engineer at the *Image-Guided Robotics Group*, [[https://www.hticiitm.org/][HTIC-IIT Madras]], currently building a Robotic Fetal Ultrasound System - leveraging multi-modal deep learning architectures for integrating standard plane detection, anatomical segmentation, and biometry extraction. 

Prior to this position at HTIC, I was a Visiting Research Scholar under [[https://www.uab.edu/shp/home/about-us/deans-office/staff/ritu-aneja][Dr. Ritu Aneja]], University of Alabama at Birmingham, where I conducted deep learning based analysis on Whole slide images obtained from breast cancer patients.

I hold a BTech in Biomedical Engineering from the National Institute of Rourkela (2021). My passion lies in driving innovation at the intersection of AI, Robotics and healthcare. I welcome connections and collaborations in this exciting field!
