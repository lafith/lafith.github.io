Hi there! I work as an AI/ML Engineer with the [[https://igrs.hticlab.org/][Image-Guided Robotic Systems Group]] at [[https://www.hticiitm.org/][HTICâ€“IIT Madras]],  where I develop intelligent systems that bridge artificial intelligence, healthcare, and medical robotics. I build deep learning models from scratch, covering architecture design, training, and deployment across a range of real-world tasks.
