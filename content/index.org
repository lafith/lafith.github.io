I am an R&D Engineer at the *Image-Guided Robotics Group*, [[https://www.hticiitm.org/][HTIC-IIT Madras]], currently building a Robotic Fetal Ultrasound System - integrating standard plane detection, anatomical segmentation, and biometry extraction. 

Prior to this position at HTIC, I was a Visiting Research Scholar under [[https://www.uab.edu/shp/home/about-us/deans-office/staff/ritu-aneja][Dr. Ritu Aneja]], University of Alabama at Birmingham, where I conducted deep learning based analysis on Whole slide images obtained from breast cancer patients.


I hold a BTech in Biomedical Engineering from the National Institute of Rourkela (2021). I have expertise in developing multi-modal deep learning architectures, conducting whole slide image analysis for cancer research, creating VR applications using game engines for medical devices, industrial CT enhancement, and building simulator for underwater robots.

My passion lies at the intersection of AI, Robotics and healthcare. I welcome connections and collaborations in this exciting field!
