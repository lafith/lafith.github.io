* Real-Time Self-Prompting Adaptation of a Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound
Adapted the Segment Anything (SAM) foundation model to be self-prompting for fetal ultrasound, achieving clinical-grade precision with 96% specificity and an inference time of just 12 ms per image. Deployed in a robotic prototype, the system reduced manual scanning time from 30–45 minutes to 4 minutes—an 85%+ efficiency improvement—enabling high-throughput prenatal screening and drawing strong interest from clinicians at the XVIII Clinical Ultrasonography in Practice (CUSP) conference.

* Deep Learning-Based Analysis of Breast Cancer Whole Slide Images
Developed convolutional and graph neural networks to analyze breast cancer whole slide images, enabling automated interpretation and patch-level annotation with high accuracy (F1 score of 0.95 across 24 classes). This work also explored links between neighborhood deprivation, tumor microenvironment, and race, with findings presented at two research symposia.

* Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Simulator
A 3D underwater simulation environment built in Unity to model the dynamics and control of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). It enables realistic testing of navigation and control algorithms in a virtual underwater setting with support for simulated sensors. Designed for rapid prototyping and validation of AUV software stacks.
