My name is Lafith. Currently I am working as a R&D Engineer for the *Image-Guided Robotics Group* at [[https://www.hticiitm.org/][HTIC-IIT Madras]], focused on Deep Learning & Reinforcement Learning.

Prior to this position at HTIC, I was a Visiting Research Scholar under [[https://www.uab.edu/shp/home/about-us/deans-office/staff/ritu-aneja][Dr. Ritu Aneja]], University of Alabama at Birmingham & [[https://math.gsu.edu/jkong/][Dr. Jun Kong]], Georgia State University.
In this role I was responsible for conducting deep learning based analysis on Whole slide images obtained from breast cancer patients.

I received a BTech in Biomedical Engineering at the National Institute of Rourkela in 2021.
Following this I worked as Project Engineer for the [[https://www.hticiitm.org/endoscope][Endoscopy]] Development group at HTIC-IITM. Here I made a VR application capable of visualizing video stream from a stereo-endoscope.
I developed and deployed deep learning models for lesion detection in edge devices.

During my Undergrad I lead the simulator development team for our Autonomous Underwater Vehicle development group-[[https://auvnitrkl.github.io/index.html][Tiburon]]. Here I built a AUV-Simulator usable for
testing algorithms in a 3D underwater environment.

I have also worked on couple of projects, related to industrial CT scans, at [[https://cci-iitpkd.github.io/][Centre for Computational Imaging-IIT Palakkad]] under the supervision of [[https://www.singaporetech.edu.sg/directory/faculty/mahesh-raveendranatha-panicker][Dr. Mahesh R Panicker]].
