Currently I am working at *MBZUAI*'s Research Office as AI Engineer. Moved to Khalifa City, a calm pleasant residential suburb near Masdar city, I really like it here.

Outside work I have been reading  *A Short History of Humanity: How Migration Made Us Who We Are* by /Johannes Krause and Thomas Trappe/. Its a fascinating work on human history from an archaeogenetics perspective. I’m planning to get back into my old habit of reading a lot in 2026. We’ll see how that goes.

I also picked up a BambuLab P1S 3D printer recently. It’s been a lot of fun printing silly but useful things for my apartment. I might even try learning some 3D modeling next.
