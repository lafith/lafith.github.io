Currently I am working at *MBZUAI*'s Research Office as an AI Engineer. I recently moved to Khalifa City, a calm and pleasant residential suburb near Masdar, and I really like it here.

Outside of work, I have been reading  *A Short History of Humanity: How Migration Made Us Who We Are* by /Johannes Krause and Thomas Trappe/. It is a fascinating look at human history from an archaeogenetics perspective. I am planning to get back into my old habit of reading a lot in 2026. We will see how that goes.

I also picked up a BambuLab P1S 3D printer recently. It has been a lot of fun printing small, silly but useful things for my apartment.
