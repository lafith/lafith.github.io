#+TITLE: Unity Shader scripts for image manipulation
#+DATE: <2022-08-21>
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

Shaders are small scripts that contain the mathematical calculations and 
algorithms for calculating the colour of each pixel rendered, based on the 
lighting input and the Material configuration. These scripts are run on GPU. This work is my
attempt to implement common image manipulation in Unity Shader Scripts.

Code is available [[https://github.com/lafith/Fragment_Shaders_Image_Manipulation/tree/main/Assets/Shaders][here]]

Basic idea is to treat the image as a texture. This will enable us to access the nearby
texels(pixels), hence enabling us to implement kernel convolution. In this Unity project I have implemented following
image effects:
- Edge Detection using Sobel Operator
- Sharpening
- Blur
- Contrast Enhancement
- Image negative
